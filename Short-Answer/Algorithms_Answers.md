Add your answers to the Algorithms exercises here.
a) O(n^3)
b) O(n^4)
c) O(n)

i would conduct a binary search algorithm
i would pick a floor near the middle (or more closer to the bottom with the knowledge that eggs will probably not take many floors to break) and drop an egg. If the egg breaks, I only need to search the floors beneath that mark, if not only above. Then I can go to the midpoint of the section i know answer is in and drop another egg, repeat the process.
